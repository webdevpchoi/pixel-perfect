# Pixel Perfect

## Description
Pixel Perfect is a web application created to connect photographers and models. Designed to showcase my experience with full-stack web development;
several core concepts such as RESTFUL routing, authentication, data associations, non-relational databases, and deployment were used in the creation
of this web app.

## Usage
Feel free to add a photographer/model of your own to test out the application!


### Note: The database is currently set up on a timer to wipe out all user-defined model/photographers every 24 hours.
